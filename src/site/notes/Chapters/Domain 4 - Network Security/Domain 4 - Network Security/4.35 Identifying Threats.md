Here, we see an example of an intrusion detection system IDS alert. This is being provided as an example of how threats are identified. Some of the concepts in this scenario are more advanced than this course. So don't be alarmed if you don't understand everything discussed here. We'll start by reviewing the main points of the data that is presented to us. Note that in this example, the host name and user name fields have been removed to maintain anonymity. This tells us that IDS detected the user of software called advanced IP scanner that can be used by Attackers to enumerate or look through the network scanning addresses to see what services are running on the computers in the local network. This software is also used by network or system administrator to inventory a local network for troubleshooting purposes. Finally, this top section of the alert screen tell us that the event was reported by an endpoint agent meaning that it was generated by a host intrusion detection system, HIDS solution,, not a network intrusion detection system, NIDS. This line identifies the host that is running the suspicious process as a Window systems. This process section identifies the start time process name or ID or PID number that correlates to the process in the Windows task manager. This can be helpful in a couple of ways. First, the start time tells us how long the process has been running. The PID can also give some clues as lower PID numbers may indicate a process that started running during the boot sequence and higher numbers indicate something that was started much later. Those lines give us the details of the executable file including the path to the file itself as well as the actual command line that was use to run the executable. These are important contextually as they show the program executed from a temp folder under the user's id, which typically does not require administrative privileges in a window systems. In other words, they could be run by any average user. The command line used shows additional context including that the application is running as a portable application, meaning that it doesn't have to be formally installed on the machine to execute. In this case, there is not enough context to really know if this process is being used in a malicious manner. Like many security alerts, this one relies on some human interaction. So you should contact the end user assigned to this asset to inquire whether they are in fact running this software. And if they have a legitimate business reason to do so. If you discover that this was intended, it might be a good place to explain too that you were alerted because this legitimate software can be used by these threat actors to conduct reconnaissance on the local network to determine where there might be weaknesses to exploit.
