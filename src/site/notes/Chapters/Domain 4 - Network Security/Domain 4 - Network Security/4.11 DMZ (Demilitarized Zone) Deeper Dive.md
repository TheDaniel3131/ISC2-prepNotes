A web front-end server might be in the DMZ but it might retrieve data from a database server that is on the other side of the firewall. For example, you may have a network where you manage your client's personal information and even if the data is encrypted or obfuscated by cryptography, you need to make sure the network is completely segregated from the rest of the network with some secure switches that only an authorized individual has access to only authorized personnel can control the firewall settings and control the traffic between the web server and the internal network. For example, in a hospital or a doctor's office, you would have a segregated network for the patient information and billing, and on the other side would be electronic medical records, if they are using a Web based application for medical record services, they would have a demilitarized zone or segmented areas and perhaps even behind the firewall. They have their own specified server to protect the crucial information and keep it segregated. It is worth noting at this point that while this course will not explore the specifics, some networks use a Web application firewall (WAF) rather than AD MZ network. The WAF has an internal and an external connection like a traditional firewall with the external traffic being filtered by the traditional or next generation firewall. First, it monitors all traffic encrypted or not from the outside for malicious behavior before passing commands to a Web server that may be internal to the network.
