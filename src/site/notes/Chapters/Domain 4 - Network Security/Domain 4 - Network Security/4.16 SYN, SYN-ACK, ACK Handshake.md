Between the client and server, there is a system for synchronizing and acknowledging any request that is known as a three way handshake. This handshake is used to establish a TCP connection between two devices. Here we will take a simplified look at it how communications are established to a web server. Depending on the exact protocol, there may be additional connection negotiation taking place. First, the client sends synchronization sin packet to the web server. Port 80 to Port 443. This is a request to establish a connection. The web server replies to the sin pack with an acknowledgement known as a sin. Finally, the client acknowledges the connection with an acknowledgement. The basic connection is established and the client and host will further negotiate secure communications over that connection.
