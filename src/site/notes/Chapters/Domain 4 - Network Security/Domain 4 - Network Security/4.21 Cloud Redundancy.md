Many organizations have moved from hardwired server rooms to operations that are run by cloud based facilities because it provides both security and flexibility. Cloud service providers have different availability zones to that if one goes down activities can shift to another. You don't have to maintain a whole data center with all the redundancy that entails the cloud service provider that does that for you. There are several ways to contract with a cloud service provider. You can set up the billing so that it depends on the data used just like your mobile phone and you have resource pooling meaning you can share in the resources of other colleagues or similar types of industries to provide data for artificial intelligence or analytic.
