First, we consider the air conditioning requirements of a data center, servers, and other equipment generate a lot of heat which must be handled appropriately. This is not just to make it comfortable when humans are present but to ensure the equipment is kept within its operating parameters. When equipment gets too hot, it can lead to quicker failure or avoided warranty. Most equipment is programmed to automatically shut down when a certain temperature threshold is met. This helps to protect the equipment but a system that is shut down is not available to the users. An abnormal system shutdown can also lead to the loss or corruption of data. Another consideration for the on premises data center is the fire suppression systems in the United States. Most commercial buildings are required to have sprinkler systems that are activated in a fire. These sprinklers minimize the amount of damage caused to the building and keep the fire from spreading to adjacent areas but they can be detrimental to electronic equipment as water and electricity as water and electricity don't mix while most water based fire suppression systems don't work like they do in the movies where a fire in one part of the building turns on the sprinklers for th entire building. Another hazard is having water overhead in a data center. Eventually water pipes will fail and may leak on equipment. The risk can be reduced somewhat by using a dry pipe system that keeps the water out of the pipes over the data center. The systems have a valve outside the data center that is only opened when  sensor indicates a fire is present. Since water is not held in the pipes above the data center, the risk of leaks is reduced.
