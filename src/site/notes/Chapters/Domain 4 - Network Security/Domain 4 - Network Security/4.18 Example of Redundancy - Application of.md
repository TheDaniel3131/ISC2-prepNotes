In addition to keeping redundant backups of information, you also have a redundant source of power to provide backup power. So you have an uninterrupted power supply or UPS transfer switches or transformers may also be involved and in case the power is interrupted by weather or blackouts, a backup generator is essential. Often, there will be two generators connected by two different transfer switches. These generators might be powered by diesel or gasoline or other fuel such as propane or even by solar panels. A hospital or essential government agency might contract with more than one power company and be on two different grids. In case, one goes out, this is what we mean by redundancy.
