VLAN are virtual separations within a switch and are used mainly to limit broadcast traffic. A VLAN can be configured to communicate with other VLANS or not and may be used to segregate network segments. There are a few common uses of VLANS in corporate networks. The first is to separate voiceover IP (VOIP) telephones from the corporate network. This is most often done to more effectively manage the network traffic generated by voicing communications by isolating it from the rest of the network. Another common use of VLAN in a corporate network is to separate the data center from all other network traffic. This makes it easier to keep use the server to server traffic contained to the data center network while allowing certain traffic from workstations or the web to access the servers as briefly discussed earlier. VLANs also can be used to segment networks. For example, a VLAN can separate the payroll workstations from the rest of the workstations in the network. Routing rules can be also used to only allow devices within this payroll VLAN to access the servers containing payroll information. Earlier, we also discussed network access control, NAC. These systems use VLANs to control whether device connect to the corporate network or to a guest network. Even though a wireless access controller may attach to a single port on a physical network switch. The VLAN associated with the device connection on the wireless access controller determines the VLAN that the device operates on and to which networks it is allowed to connect. Finally in a large corporate networks, VLANs can be used to limit the amount of broadcast traffic within a network. This is most common in networks of more than 1000 devices and may be separated by department location, building or any other criteria as needed. The most important thing to remember is that while VLANs are logically separated, they may be allowed to access other VLANs. They can also be configured to deny access to other VLANs.
