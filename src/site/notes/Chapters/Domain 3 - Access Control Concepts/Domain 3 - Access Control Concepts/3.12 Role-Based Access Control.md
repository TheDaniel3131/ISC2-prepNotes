A role is created and assigned the access required for personnel working in that role. When a user takes a job, the administrator assigns them to the appropriate role. If a user leaves that role, the administrator removes that user and then access for that user associated with that role is removed. Aach works well in an environment with high staff turnover and multiple personnel with similar access requirements.
