Whether a user is authorized or unauthorized depends on their user provisioning which is an identity management process for creating and managing access to resources and information systems. While we usually think of user provisioning as creating new accounts, there are several different situations which require action by a security administrator who is responsible for provisioning user accounts. In fact, Susan finds herself in a situation that requires changes to a user provisioning. Let's check in with her as she notifies the security administrator of this change. Susan is talking to her security administrator. 

Hi. Uhm. One of my employees is going to be taking a temporary leave of absence. Demetra, she's going to be taking a sabbatical from work and she's not going to need access to the systems since Demetri will not be accessing the systems. The security admin recommends disabling her accounts while she's not at work because this reduces the risk that her account could be used by an unauthorized person while she's on leave. He tells Susan to make the request. Then according to the company policy and procedures, he will disable dimitri's login account. So she's not allowed to log into the company systems while out on leave. So, will make this things complicated when demetri does return to work? Oh, I see. So, even though the amount id disabled but not otherwise modified, it will be easy to reactivate it once she returns. Ok. That's great news because I'm going to need her.
