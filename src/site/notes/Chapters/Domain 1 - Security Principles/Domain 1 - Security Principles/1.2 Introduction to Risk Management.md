The level of cybersecurity required depends on the level of risk, the entity is willing to accept that is the potential consequences of what's going on in our environment.  Once we evaluate the risks, then we will implement security controls to mitigate the risk to  the level that we find acceptable.  Risks can be from cyber attacks such as malware, social engineering, or denial of service attacks or from other situations that affect our environment such as fire, violent crime or natural disasters. With well designed risk management technologies, we can recognize vulnerabilities and threats and calculate the likelihood and impact of each threat.
