Privacy is a major component of information security. Once we know how private the information is, we know what appropriate controls can be implemented. A number of standards, policies and procedures govern privacy in the working environment. And these vary by geographic region in the United States, Hipaa, the health insurance, portability and accountability Act controls how the privacy of medical information must be maintained in the European Union. EU, the general data protection regulation gives anyone within the borders of the EU control over what personal information companies can compile and retain about them as a security professional. It's important to be aware of privacy laws and regulations in all jurisdictions where your company conducts business. When doing business in other countries, we must be aware of their privacy standards and regulations and act accordingly.
