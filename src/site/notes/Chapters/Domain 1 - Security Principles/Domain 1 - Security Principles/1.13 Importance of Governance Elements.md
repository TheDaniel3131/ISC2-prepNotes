Regulations and laws can affect the day to day operations of many organizations. One example of a law with a broad impact is the general data protection regulation, "GDPR" which affords data protection and control to individuals within the territorial boundaries of the EU regardless of citizenship. As another example in the United States, patient medical information is governed by the health care insurance, "Portability and Accountability Act of 1996", "HIPA", and must be closely guarded from the information security perspective. A high standard of professionalism is expected in safeguarding data on the patient's behalf. Information security is based on trust and credibility. If something goes wrong, the stakeholders trust evaporates and organization's credibility is damaged sometimes without cure. "HIPA", is also carries significant criminal and financial penalties for non compliance for both the organization and the individuals involved. Fortunately, there are published frameworks or standards to guide the organizational policies that support the compliance effort. Many departments or work groups within the organization implement procedures that detail how they  complete day to day tasks while remaining compliant. Among these groups is the International Organization for Standardization, "ISO". ISO is an international standards body. One of the standards that ISO publishes is how to destroy data in a secure fashion.
