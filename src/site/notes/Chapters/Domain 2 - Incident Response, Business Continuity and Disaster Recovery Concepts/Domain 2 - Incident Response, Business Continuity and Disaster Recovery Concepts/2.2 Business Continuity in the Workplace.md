Obviously, the business continuity plan needs to be maintained somewhere where it can be accessed often in modern organizations, everything is digital and not provided as a hard copy. This can be dangerous just like storing everything within the main company building. Some organizations have what is called the red book, which is given to the appropriate individual outside the facility. All the procedures are outlined in that document in the case for example, hurricane hits the power is out and all the facilities are compromised and there is no access to electronic backups. It is important to update this hard copy red book any time the electronic copy is updated. So both versions remained consistent.
