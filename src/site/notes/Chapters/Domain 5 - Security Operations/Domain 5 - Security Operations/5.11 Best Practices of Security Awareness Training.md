We have to make sure we have appropriate communications about current and potential threats to keep awareness high. We could even encourage friendly competition between departments to spot most fishing attempts. We can offer friendly reminders like a little squishy stress ball that says lock your computer. There are also automatic systems that lock the computer automatically. When you step away, it is important to make sure we get positive feedback about our training ensuring it is appropriate and understood. Make sure the organization's leaders understand the important of training and working to promote and improve the information security environment of the organization and provide the opportunity for personnel to practice what they've learned with exercises and simulations. Occasionally send simulated fishing emails for example and give them positive feedback for reporting it. Depending on the organization's culture and risk profile awareness training should be a positive experience for everyone and not punitive unless it is absolute necessary.
