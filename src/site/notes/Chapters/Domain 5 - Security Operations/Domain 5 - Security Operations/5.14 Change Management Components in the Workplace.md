Change management happens in a cycle. There is no real stopping point. It is continuously going. There is no real stopping point, it is continuously going. This means that there must be continuous monitoring of that environment. So, if you or anyone should request a change It needs to go through the appropriate approvals, the organization must be prepared for roll back if necessary. Meaning that if a particular change did not work, we need to be able to roll back to the legacy system. While change management is an organization wide process, it often fails on information security professionals to coordinate the effort and maybe to provide oversight and governance depending on the size of the organization. It may also fall under an IT or development area in organizations that have a quality or risk management department. It would be a great fit in either of those areas too. The common theme is that change management acknowledges and incorporates input from the end users as well as all areas of IT, development, information security, and most importantly management to ensure that all changes are properly tested, approved, and communicated prior to being implemented.
