Susan stops into Javis every morning for a cup of coffee on her way to work this morning. She observes that Keith is looking sad. Hey, Keith, you having a hard morning. You seem a little down. Yeah, I was up late last night searching the internet trying to figure out what to do with my life. You're in cybersecurity, right. Yeah, I was searching the Internet and found out that that's one of the fastest growing careers But what does that even mean? Well, yes. I am in cybersecurity and it means that I protect online data from being stolen or altered. Yeah, I assess risks to our network and respond with various safeguards. Do you think you might be interested in cybersecurity. No, no, I am not good with computers. Plus I took a computer programming class in high school and that didn't turn out too well.


Long story short, you don't have to be coders to be cybersecurity professionals. Understanding the infrastructure and manage that is more important
